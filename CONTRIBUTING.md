# 👋 Contributing to TESS

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! TESS is an open-source project, and we love seeing new faces here. 🚀

## 🛠️ How Can I Help?

-   **Report Bugs:** Found a glitch in the matrix? Open an issue!
-   **Suggest Features:** Have a crazy idea for an AI agent? We want to hear it.
-   **Submit Pull Requests:** wrote some code? Send it over!

## 💻 Setting Up Dev Environment

## 🎨 Coding Style

*   We use **Python 3.10+** (because match/case is cool).
*   Keep comments "human" and friendly! No robotic `"Class to do X"` please.
*   Use `rich` for any terminal output. We like it pretty.

3.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: Add amazing feature'`).
